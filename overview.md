# Overview

An SFU (Selective Forwarder Unit) receives audio and video streams from every participant in a conference room and relays them to everyone else (endpoints send one and receive many). Compared to a mixer or MCU (Multipoint Control Unit), this design leads to a better performance, higher throughput and less latency. It's highly scalable and requires much less resources given that it does not transcode or mix media.

Since endpoints get the other participants media separately, they can have a personalized layout and choose which streams to render and how to display them.

Detailed information regarding the architecture of an SFU can be found at RFC 7667 "RTP Topologies" [section 3.7](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7667#section-3.7).

Unlike other existing SFU implementations, **mediasoup** is not a standalone server but an unopinionated Node.js library which can be integrated into a larger application:

```javascript
var mediasoup = require('mediasoup');
```

Thus internally, **mediasoup** can be splitted into two separete components:

* a JavaScript layer exposing a modern ECMAScript 6 [API](/api/), and
* a subprocess that handles the media layer (ICE, DTLS, RTP and so on).

Both components communicate to each other by means of inter-process communication. However, from the point of view of the developer, the application integrating **mediasoup** should just care about the JavaScript [API](/api/) exposed by the library.

It's also noticeable the fact that **mediasoup** does not include or mandate a network signaling protocol (such as SIP or XMPP) but, instead, lets the application developer choose and implement the desired one.


## Design goals

* Be a Node.js library: `npm install mediasoup`
* Be minimalist: just handle the media layer
* Expose a modern ECMAScript 6 [API](/api/) in sync with [ORTC](http://ortc.org/)
* Work with current WebRTC client implementations


## Features

* Multiple conference rooms with multiple participants
* IPv6 ready
* ICE / DTLS / RTP / RTCP / DataChannel over UDP and TCP
* Extremely powerful (media handler subprocess coded in C++ on top of [libuv](http://libuv.org))
* Can handle RTP packets in JavaScript land


## Requirements

* Node.js >= `v4.0.0`
* POSIX based operating system (Windows not yet supported)
* Must run in a publicly reachable host (ICE "Lite" implementation)
