# F.A.Q.

{: toc}


### Why a Node.js module?
{: #why-a-nodejs-module}

You may wonder "why not a standalone server?". That's a fair question.

Being a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) module, **mediasoup** is easily integrable within larger Node.js applications. Consider that **mediasoup** just handles the media plane (audio/video streams) so the application needs some kind of signaling mechanism. Having both the signaling and the media handlers working together makes the application architecture easier.

All those using others languages/platforms for the signaling plane would need to develop their own communication channel with a standalone Node.js server running **mediasoup** (or wait for somebody to do it).


### Is mediasoup a native addon?
{: #is-mediasoup-a-native-addon}

Not exactly. [Native addons](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) are Node.js extensions written in C/C++ that can be loaded using `require()` as if they were ordinary Node.js modules.

Instead, **mediasoup** launches a set of C++ child processes ([media workers](https://github.com/ibc/mediasoup/tree/master/worker)) and communicates with them by means of inter-process communication. This approach leads to a media worker design not tiled to the internals of Node.js or V8 (which change in every new release).


### Which signaling protocol does it use?
{: #which-signaling-protocol-does-it-use}

That's a wrong question. **mediasoup** does not provide any network signaling protocol to communicate with endpoints/browsers. It just handles the media layer and also provides a set of messages (*mediasoup protocol*) generated by both **mediasoup-client** (client side) and **mediasoup** (server side) that must be exchanged between both.

It's up to the application developer to build his preferred signaling protocol to carry those messages.


### Is there any example code?
{: #is-there-any-example-code}

Yes, check the [examples](/documentation/examples/).


### Does mediasoup transcode?
{: #does-mediasoup-transcode}

No. All the peers in a room should support a common subset of audio and video codecs. Said that, WebRTC defines a list of MTI ("mandatory to implement") audio/video codecs, so in a world of happy unicorns this topic should not be a problem.


### Does it work with legacy SIP endpoints?
{: #does-it-work-with-legacy-sip-endpoints}

No.


### Running mediasoup in hosts with private IP (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
{: #running-mediasoup-in-hosts-with-private-ip}

Those environments run virtual hosts with private IP and provide mechanisms to route an external public IP into that private IP. **mediasoup** implements ICE-Lite meaning that it won't initiate ICE connections but will always act as ICE "server" role.

In order to run **mediasoup** in those environments (host with private IP and a mapped public IP):

* Let `HOST_PRIVATE_IP` be the internal private IP of the host.
* Let `HOST_PUBLIC_IP` be the external public IP mapped to `HOST_PRIVATE_IP`.
* Make `rtcIPv4` or `rtcIPv6` (in [ServerSettings](/documentation/mediasoup/api/#Server-ServerSettings)) point to `HOST_PRIVATE_IP`.
* Make `rtcAnnouncedIPv4` or `rtcAnnouncedIPv6` point to `HOST_PUBLIC_IP`.
* Redirect the port range given by `rtcMinPort`-`rtcMaxPort` from `HOST_PUBLIC_IP` to `HOST_PRIVATE_IP`.
* And, of course, also redirect whichever port your application uses for signaling (HTTP/WebSocket) from `HOST_PUBLIC_IP` to `HOST_PRIVATE_IP`.
