# F.A.Q.


### Why a Node.js library?

You may wonder "why not a standalone server?". That's a fair question.

Being a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) library, **mediasoup** is easily integrable within larger Node.js applications. Consider that **mediasoup** just handles the media plane (audio/video streams) so the application needs some kind of signaling mechanism (let it be SIP, XMPP or whichever custom signaling protocol). Having both the signaling and the media handlers working together makes the application architecture easier.

All those using others languages/platforms for the signaling plane would need to develop their own communication means with a standalone Node.js server running **mediasoup** (or wait for somebody to do it).


### Why ORTC?

[ORTC](http://ortc.org/) is a more granular and "Object" based API for WebRTC. Moreover, the [WebRTC draft](http://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/) is evolving to the "Object" model so both specifications are converging.

By providing a similar API, the developer does not need to learn yet another WebRTC API when it comes to write a **mediasoup** based application.


### What about SDP?

**mediasoup** does not consume/produce SDP blobs. In order to interoperate with current WebRTC 1.0 browsers, the application is responsible of parsing the SDP entities generated by remote peers, extracting the proper information from them, and translate such an information into **mediasoup** [API](/api/) calls. And vice-versa (generate SDP entities to make WebRTC 1.0 endpoints happy).

Of course, "someone" may produce a Node.js library/utility that deals with that stuff. :)
