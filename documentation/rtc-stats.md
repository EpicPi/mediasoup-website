# RTC stats

Similar to [WebRTC](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-stats/) and [ORTC](http://draft.ortc.org/#rtcstats-dictionary), **mediasoup** provides stats in server side. If enabled, they are also delivered to **mediasoup-client**.

Currently stats are generated for the following entities:

* [WebRtcTransport](/documentation/mediasoup/api/#WebRtcTransport)
* [Producer](/documentation/mediasoup/api/#Producer)
* [Consumer](/documentation/mediasoup/api/#Consumer)

Stats are an Array of Objects.

*TODO*: Detail how stats look.
