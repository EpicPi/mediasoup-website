## Consumer
{: #Consumer}

<section markdown="1">

A consumer represents an audio or video source being forwarded from a mediasoup router to an endpoint. It's created on top of a transport that defines how the media packets are carried.

<div markdown="1" class="note">
When creating a consumer it's recommended to set `paused` to `true`, then transmit the consumer parameters to the consuming endpoint and, once the consuming endpoint has created its local side consumer, unpause the server side consumer using the [resume()](#consumer-resume) method.

Reasons for create the server side consumer in `paused` mode:

* If the remote endpoint is a WebRTC browser or application and it receives a RTP packet of the new consumer **before** the remote `RTCPeerConnection` is ready to process it (this is, before the remote consumer is created in the remote endpoint) it may happen that the `RTCPeerConnection` will wrongly associate the SSRC of the received packet to an already existing SDP `m=` section, so the imminent creation of the new consumer and its associated `m=` section will fail.
  * Related [issue](https://github.com/versatica/libmediasoupclient/issues/57).

* Also, when creating a video consumer, this is an optimization to make it possible for the consuming endpoint to render the video as far as possible. If the server side consumer was created with `paused: false`, mediasoup will immediately request a key frame to the producer and that key frame may reach the consuming endpoint even before it's ready to consume it, generating "black" video until the device requests a keyframe by itself.

</div>

#### consumer.on("layerschange", fn(layers))
{: #consumer-on-layerschange .code}

Emitted when the spatial/temporal layers being sent to the endpoint change. Just for simulcast or SVC consumers.

<div markdown="1" class="table-wrapper L3">

Argument  | Type    | Description   
--------- | ------- | ----------------
`layers`   | [ConsumerLayers](#ConsumerLayers)\|Null | Current spatial and temporal layers (or `null` if there are no current layers).

</div>

<div markdown="1" class="note">
This event is emitted under various circumstances in SVC or simulcast consumers (assuming the consumer endpoints supports BWE via REMB or Transport-CC):

* When the consumer (or its associated producer) is paused.
* When all the RTP streams of the associated producer become inactive (no RTP received for a while).
* When the available bitrate of the BWE makes the consumer upgrade or downgrade the spatial and/or temporal layers.
* When there is no available bitrate for this consumer (even for the lowest layers) so the event fires with `null` as argument.

The Node.js application can detect the latter (consumer deactivated due to not enough bandwidth) by checking if both `consumer.paused` and `consumer.producerPaused` are falsy after the consumer has emitted this event with `null` as argument.
</div>

#### consumer.on("packet", fn(packet))
{: #consumer-on-packet .code}

See [enablePacketEvent()](#consumer-enablePacketEvent) method.
