Field         | Type    | Description   | Required | Default
------------- | ------- | ------------- | -------- | ---------
`listenIp`    | [TransportListenIp](#TransportListenIp)\|String| Listening IP address. | Yes |
`rtcpMux`     | Boolean | Use RTCP-mux (RTP and RTCP in the same port). | No | `true`
`comedia`     | Boolean | Whether remote IP:port should be auto-detected based on first RTP/RTCP packet received. If enabled, `connect()` method must not be called. This option is ignored if `multiSource` is set. | No | `false`
`multiSource` | Boolean | Whether RTP/RTCP from different remote IPs:ports is allowed. If set, the transport will just be valid for receiving media (`consume()` cannot be called on it) and `connect()` must not be called. | No | `false`
`enableSctp`  | Boolean | Create a SCTP association. | No | `false`
`numSctpStreams`     | [TransportNumSctpStreams](#TransportNumSctpStreams) | SCTP streams number. | No |
`maxSctpMessageSize` | Number | Maximum size of data that can be passed to DataProducer's send() method. | No | 262144
`appData`     | Object  | Custom application data. | No | `{ }`

<div markdown="1" class="note">
* Note that `comedia` mode just makes sense when the remote endpoint is gonna produce RTP on this plain RTP transport. Otherwise, if the remote endpoint does not send any RTP packet to mediasoup, there is no way to detect its remote RTP IP and port, so the endpoint won't receive any packet from mediasoup.
  * In other words, do not use `comedia` mode if the remote endpoint is not going to produce RTP but just consume it. In those cases, do not set `comedia` flag and call [connect()](#plainRtpTransport-connect) with the IP and port(s) of the remote endpoint. 

* When `multiSource` is set, the producer endpoint won't receive any RTCP packet from mediasoup. Try to avoid `multiSource` if possible. In case of video, if the producer does not send periodic video key frames, consumers will have problems to render the video (since RTCP PLI or FIR cannot be delivered to the producer if `multiSource` is set).

### Properties
{: #PlainRtpTransport-properties}

<section markdown="1">

See also [Transport Properties](#Transport-properties).

#### plainRtpTransport.tuple
{: #plainRtpTransport-tuple .code}

The transport tuple. It's set after calling `connect()` method (it's `undefined` otherwise). If RTCP-mux is enabled, this tuple refers to both RTP and RTCP.

#### plainRtpTransport.rtcpTuple
{: #plainRtpTransport-rtcpTuple .code}

The transport tuple for RTCP. It's set after calling `connect()` method just if RTCP-mux is not enabled.
